***The bankruptcy story***

Suzanne wants to build an algorithm to predict whether a company is about to declare bankruptcy over the next few months. She has access to a labeled dataset with detailed financial information from thousands of companies, including those that have declared bankruptcy over the last 100 years. Suzanne has some ideas but would love to hear what you think.

**Understanding that there are many ways to approach a problem, what would be your first recommendation to Suzanne?**
- [ ] The best way to approach this problem is with Supervised Learning by using a regression algorithm.
- [x] The best way to approach this problem is with Supervised Learning by using a classification algorithm.
- [ ] The best way to approach this problem is with Unsupervised Learning by using a clustering algorithm.
- [ ] The best way to approach this problem is with Reinforcement Learning.
