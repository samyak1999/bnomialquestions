***One of these shouldn't be here***

Here are four different techniques commonly used in machine learning.

Although they are all related somehow, one of them is different from the rest. Your goal is to determine which of the following doesn't belong on this list.
**Can you select the odd one out?**

- [ ] Expectation-Maximization
- [x] PCA
- [ ] DBSCAN
- [ ] K-means

***The bankruptcy story***

Suzanne wants to build an algorithm to predict whether a company is about to declare bankruptcy over the next few months. She has access to a labeled dataset with detailed financial information from thousands of companies, including those that have declared bankruptcy over the last 100 years. Suzanne has some ideas but would love to hear what you think.

**Understanding that there are many ways to approach a problem, what would be your first recommendation to Suzanne?**
- [ ] The best way to approach this problem is with Supervised Learning by using a regression algorithm.
- [x] The best way to approach this problem is with Supervised Learning by using a classification algorithm.
- [ ] The best way to approach this problem is with Unsupervised Learning by using a clustering algorithm.
- [ ] The best way to approach this problem is with Reinforcement Learning.

***A batch of rotated pictures***

After looking at the last batch of images, the problem was apparent:

Customers were taking pictures and sending them with different degrees of rotation. The Convolutional Neural Network that Jessica built wasn't ready to handle this. She knew she needed to do something about it. A couple of meetings later, Jessica knew what the right solution was. It took some time for the team to agree, but they had a plan now.

**Which of the following approaches could Jessica have proposed?**

- [ ] Extending the pipeline with a data preprocessing step to properly rotate every image coming from the customer before giving the data to the model.
- [ ] Extending the model with a layer capable of rotating the data to the correct position.
- [ ] Extending the training data with samples of images rotated across the full 360-degree spectrum to build some rotation invariability into the model.
- [ ] Configuring the network correctly since Convolutional Neural Networks are translation and rotation invariant and should handle these images correctly.

***Alex's model is not doing well***

Alex is a Machine Learning Engineer working for a new photo-sharing startup.

His team started building a model to predict the likeability of every new image posted on the platform. They collected some data and built a simple classification model.*Unfortunately*, Alex quickly realizes that the model doesn't perform well. He notices that the training error is not as low as expected.

**What do you think is happening with Alex's model?**

- [x] It's very likely that the model suffers from high bias and is underfitting. This usually happens when the model is not complex enough and can't capture the relationship between input and output variables.
- [ ] It's very likely that the model suffers from low bias and is underfitting. This usually happens when the model is not complex enough and can't capture the relationship between input and output variables.
- [ ] It's very likely that the model suffers from high variance and is overfitting. This usually happens when the model is too complex and captures the noise of the data.
- [ ] It's very likely that the model suffers from low variance and is overfitting. This usually happens when the model is too complex and captures the noise of the data.
