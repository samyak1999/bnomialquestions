***The bankruptcy story***

Suzanne wants to build an algorithm to predict whether a company is about to declare bankruptcy over the next few months. She has access to a labeled dataset with detailed financial information from thousands of companies, including those that have declared bankruptcy over the last 100 years. Suzanne has some ideas but would love to hear what you think.

**Understanding that there are many ways to approach a problem, what would be your first recommendation to Suzanne?**
- [ ] The best way to approach this problem is with Supervised Learning by using a regression algorithm.
- [x] The best way to approach this problem is with Supervised Learning by using a classification algorithm.
- [ ] The best way to approach this problem is with Unsupervised Learning by using a clustering algorithm.
- [ ] The best way to approach this problem is with Reinforcement Learning.

***A batch of rotated pictures***

After looking at the last batch of images, the problem was apparent:

Customers were taking pictures and sending them with different degrees of rotation. The Convolutional Neural Network that Jessica built wasn't ready to handle this. She knew she needed to do something about it. A couple of meetings later, Jessica knew what the right solution was. It took some time for the team to agree, but they had a plan now.

**Which of the following approaches could Jessica have proposed?**

- [ ] Extending the pipeline with a data preprocessing step to properly rotate every image coming from the customer before giving the data to the model.
- [ ] Extending the model with a layer capable of rotating the data to the correct position.
- [ ] Extending the training data with samples of images rotated across the full 360-degree spectrum to build some rotation invariability into the model.
- [ ] Configuring the network correctly since Convolutional Neural Networks are translation and rotation invariant and should handle these images correctly.

***Alex's model is not doing well***

Alex is a Machine Learning Engineer working for a new photo-sharing startup.

His team started building a model to predict the likeability of every new image posted on the platform. They collected some data and built a simple classification model.*Unfortunately*, Alex quickly realizes that the model doesn't perform well. He notices that the training error is not as low as expected.

**What do you think is happening with Alex's model?**

- [x] It's very likely that the model suffers from high bias and is underfitting. This usually happens when the model is not complex enough and can't capture the relationship between input and output variables.
- [ ] It's very likely that the model suffers from low bias and is underfitting. This usually happens when the model is not complex enough and can't capture the relationship between input and output variables.
- [ ] It's very likely that the model suffers from high variance and is overfitting. This usually happens when the model is too complex and captures the noise of the data.
- [ ] It's very likely that the model suffers from low variance and is overfitting. This usually happens when the model is too complex and captures the noise of the data.

***Behind Gradient Descent***

It's 2030, and neural networks are taught at high schools worldwide.

It makes sense. Few subjects are as impactful to society as machine learning, so it's only appropriate that schools get students onboard from a very early age. Lillian spent a long time learning about gradient descent and how it's an optimization algorithm frequently used in machine learning applications. This is Lillian's last exam. The first question asks her to describe in a few words how gradient descent works.

**Which of the following statements is a sensible description of how the algorithm works?**

- [ ] Gradient descent identifies the minimum loss and adjusts every parameter proportionally to this loss.
- [ ] Gradient descent searches every possible combination of parameters to find the optimal loss.
- [x] Gradient descent identifies the slope in all directions and adjusts the parameters to move them in the direction of the negative slope.
- [ ] Gradient descent identifies the slope in all directions and adjusts the parameters to move them in the direction of the slope.

***A recommendation for Adrienne***

Kaggle looked like the perfect opportunity for Adrienne to start practicing machine learning.

She went online and started listening to the conversations about popular Kagglers. One particular topic caught her attention: They kept discussing different ways to create ensembles. Adrienne knew that ensemble learning is a powerful technique where you combine the decisions from multiple models to improve the overall performance. She had never used ensembles before, so she decided this was the place to start.

**Which of the following are valid ensemble techniques that Adrienne could study?**

- [x] Max Voting: Multiple models make predictions for each sample. The final prediction is the one produced by the majority of the models.
- [x] Weighted Voting: Multiple models make predictions for each sample, and each model is assigned a different weight. The final prediction considers the importance of the model in determining the final vote.
- [x] Simple Averaging: Multiple models make predictions for each sample. The final prediction is the average of all of those predictions.
- [x] Weighted Averaging: Multiple models make predictions for each sample, and each model is assigned a different weight. The final prediction is the average of all of those predictions, considering the importance of each model.

***Sometimes, small is better***

Fynn is new to a team working on a neural network model. Unfortunately, they haven't been happy with the results so far. Fynn thinks that he found the problem: they chose a batch size as large as it fits into the GPU memory. His colleagues believe this is the right approach, but Fynn believes a smaller batch size will be better.

**What would be good arguments to support Fynn's suspicion?**

- [ ] A smaller batch size is more computationally effective.
- [x] A smaller batch size reduces overfitting because it increases the noise in the training process.
- [ ] A smaller batch size reduces overfitting because it increases the noise in the training process.
- [x] A smaller batch size can improve the generalization of the model.

***Reese's baseline***

Starting with a simple baseline is a great way to approach a new problem.
Reese knew that, and her go-to has always been a simple Linear Regression, probably one of the most popular algorithms in statistics and machine learning. But Reese knows that for Linear Regression to work, she must consider several assumptions about the problem.

**Which of the following are some of the assumptions that Reese should make for Linear Regression to be a good candidate for her baseline?**

- [x] The relationship between the features in the data and the target variable must be linear.
- [ ] The features in the data are highly correlated between them.
- [x] The features in the data and the target variable are not noisy.
- [ ] There must not be more than two relevant features plus the target variable.

***Migrating to PyTorch Lightning***

Many of the old team members have left Layla's company, forcing them to start building a new team.

They have been hiring from local universities, and most new hires brought a lot of experience in PyTorch Lightning. Unfortunately for Layla's company, their main product uses TensorFlow.

After some discussions, Layla's team decided to migrate their model to PyTorch Lightning. This change, however, will not come without making some concessions.

**Which of the following are some of the downsides of this decision?**
- [ ] The team will lose the ability to deploy the model in TPUs (Tensor Processing Units), limiting them to GPUs and CPUs.
- [ ] The team won't be able to use tools like TensorBoard during the training process, so they will need to find an equivalent tool compatible with PyTorch Lightning.
- [x] The team will have to invest time to migrate the deployment process of their model from TensorFlow Serving to something like TorchServe or PyTorch Live.
- [x] Migrating the existing codebase to PyTorch Lightning could introduce unforeseen problems that could cause issues with the new model.

***The brains behind transformers***

It took some time, but Kinsley finished replacing her old model based on a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network with a new version using Transformers.

The results of the new model were impressive. The whole team was thrilled with Kinsley's work, and the company organized an internal session for Kinsley to bring everyone up to speed. After finishing her speech, a coworker asked Kinsley a question:

**Which company invented the Transformer architecture?**

- [ ] Hugging Face
- [ ] OpenAI
- [x]Google
- [ ] Allen Institute of AI
